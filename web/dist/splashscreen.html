          Acorn is a way of organizing intended goals and outcomes in tree-like
          structures. You can think of it as a virtual whiteboard for
          collaborative planning. It could have many uses, and one that it has
          served is organizing the vision and work allocation of distributed
          teams of software developers. Other uses could be as a personal
          planning tool, for teams completely aside from software, or anything
          where linked/inter-related nodes in a structured form would be
          helpful.
