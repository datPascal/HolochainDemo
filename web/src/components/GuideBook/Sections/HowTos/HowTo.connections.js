            In Acorn, if a card is already a child of another card, you won't be
            able to add another parent to it. If you wish to change its parent,
            you'd need to remove the existing connection first.

            If you would like to connect multiple cards to another card at once,
            you can use the Connector feature in Multi Edit Mode:

            <br />
            <ol>
              <li>
                1. Select all the cards you want to connect, then click on the
                Connector Icon on the Multi Edit Bar at the bottom of the
                screen.
              </li>
              <li>
                2. You will see two drop downs: For the "Connect" dropdown
                select the parent card of your choice. For the "Children" choose
                the card(s) that you want connected to the chosen parent card.
              </li>
              <li>
                3. Click Preview to see how the new connection will look like on
                the map. If happy with the results, click on "Save Changes".

              Please note, the availablity of these selections depend on
