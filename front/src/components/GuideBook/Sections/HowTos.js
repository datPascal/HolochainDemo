                Hierarchy adds another level of metadata to your goals. On

                Branch (Sub-goal) Leaf (small goal) There is also the default
                option of “no hierarchy”. Setting hierarchy for goals in a
                complex project would help you and your team to be able to see
                how bigger goals can break down to smaller units. While having
                the bigger goals in the vision, your team would be able to
                easily identify leaf (small) goals to complete. Completing small
                goals more effectively, your team can see the progress being
                made, feel accomplished, and know clearly where they are headed.

                Point Connector is a feature that lets you connect your existing
                cards quickly by connecting them 'point-to-point'. In Acorn
                cards can only have one parent, but can have many children.

                When you hover over or select an existing card, you will see the
                Point Connector dots near the top and/or bottom of the card. In
                order to connect the chosen card to another card simply click on
                one of the purple dots and drag the created line to near another
                card which you want to connect your cards to. Point Connector
                dots will have appeared near any card that it is possible to
                connect to. Now release the trackpad/mouse on the card, or dot
                of that card, that you want. The cards in the map will rearrange
                automatically based on the new connection. Using the top dot of
                a card means that card will be the child in the relationship.
                Using the bottom dot of the card means that it will be the
                parent in the relationship.

                Priority View Mode is an alternative view mode to the Map View

                decision making on priority of the goals that you set on the
                map. For determining the priority of goals we have allocated 4

                In complex projects as the number of goals (and sometimes number

                All the team members (who have editing permssion) would be able
                to “weigh in” their vote for these 4 factors for each goal
                (either in map view or priority view) The “aggregated priority”
                that results from this collective poll will determine where each
                goal will stand on the priority view mode.
