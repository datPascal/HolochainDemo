        <div class="splash-description">Acorn is a way of organizing intended goals and outcomes in tree-like structures. You can think of it as a virtual whiteboard for collaborative planning. It could have many uses, and one that it has served is organizing the vision and work allocation of distributed teams of software developers. Other uses could be as a personal planning tool, for teams completely aside from software, or anything where linked/inter-related nodes in a structured form would be helpful.</div>
